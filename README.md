## About Me
Hello! I’m Justin and I am a new graduate of the University of California, Santa Barbara with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with an interest in machine learning and natural language processing. During the Summer of 2022, I interned at Sermonis.ai as a Machine Learning Engineer where I built natural language processing models to create intelligent virtual assistants for use in commercial and industrial purposes.

In the past, I worked as a Web Developer Intern at the University of California San Francisco Library CKM Office where I was a frontend web developer as well as a software QA tester for the IndustryDocumentsLibrary and the Illios Project.

Besides computer science, a big passion of mine is linguistics and language learning which fuels my interest in natural language processing. Along with English, I can speak Cantonese, French, German, and a beginner-level Italian

I am currently in search of a career in software development, data science, machine learning, cybersecurity, and project management. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions for me!
